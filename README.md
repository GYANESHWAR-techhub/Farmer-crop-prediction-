AgriVistaar – Kisan ka Sathi is a farmer‑friendly precision agriculture web app that helps Indian farmers make smarter crop and mandi decisions using drone imagery, data analysis, and an AI pipeline.
​

The platform takes drone‑captured field images and runs them through a planned AI/ML pipeline to detect pest attacks, nutrient deficiency, and yield variation across plots, then combines these insights with mandi trends and a profit calculator so farmers can see crop health, estimate income, and choose the best time and market to sell.
